# Blockchain Commons QR Vault

**QR Vault** is a secure place to store your QR codes. There are no third party libraries used, it is a simple app that uses powerful encryption to keep your secrets safe. QR Vault can be added to your "share actions" so it can be used in any app that allows you to export images. In this way you can save your QR codes from other apps without even taking a screen shot.

Please join our testflight [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/X7Ri4nPp). Pleae share any crash reports or bugs, if you want a feature added just ask.

## Additional Information

**QR Vault** never uploads your data and does not use a server at all. It utilizes the "Sign in with Apple" tool for 2FA (two-factor authentication) purposes to ensure only you can export and delete your QR codes.

**QR Vault** allows you to add QR's via images, scanning or via text.

It is a Mac Catalyst app and will work on your MacBook, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.

## Status - Late Alpha

**QR Vault** is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@LifeWithAlacrity.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:
