<hr>

**Gordian QRTool** is a reference tool that acts as a secure place to store and backup sensitive data that is encoded into QRs. Powered by [Uniform Resource](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md), it was built to store SSKRs, PSBTs, and seeds encoded using [URs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md), however it can also be used to store other sorts of sensitive data such as 2FAs.

## Additional Information

Data is always stored with multiple layers of encryption using your device's keychain.

To ensure you can backup & recover from iCloud you **must** be signed in with the same Apple ID and must enable "Keychain" on your device's iCloud settings.

### Docs

- [**Manual**](Docs/MANUAL.md). A quick overview on using **Gordian QRTool**.

### Features

**Gordian QRTool** demonstrates security, usability, and interoperability best practices with a number of core features:

- Multiple layers of encryption
- Automated iCloud backup and recovery
- 2FA using the "Sign in with Apple" feature to ensure only you can decrypt your data
- Bitcoin centric! Convert plain text bip39 mnemonics, [SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr) shards, PSBTs (more coming soon) into [UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) and stream them for airgapped use
- [LifeHashes](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash) to deterministically derive unique visual fingerprints of each item, always derived in real time before being displayed to make it obvious if your data has been altered
- Recognizes any UR type
- An ideal app to recommend to friends and family to backup SSKR shards
- Converts any amount of text into an animated UR QR code
- Scan a QR or paste text to create new items
- Easily build the project on your MacBook, iPhone iPad, iTouch using the same small codebase, or download the app directly from the Apple Store

## Gordian Principles

**Gordian QRTool** is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** QRTool allows you to store your own QR codes and Uniform Resources, giving you ultimate control over that data.
* **Privacy.** QRTool uses the same standards for privacy that Blockchain Commons applies to its pure cryptographic tools. Your data is encrypted and protected.
* **Resilience.** QRTool allows you to maintain copies of vital information such as cryptographic seeds, xprvs, and 2FAs.
* **Openness.** QRTool is built to support the interoperable [UR specification](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

## Installation Instructions

**Gordian QRTool** can be purchased for the iPhone from the [Apple Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070) or can be compiled from the source here.

For full functionality of the iCloud backup, be sure to turn on the following functionality under "Settings > Apple ID > iCloud" on all devices running **Gordian QR Tool**:

* Keychain
* iCloud Drive

Be _very_ certain that all devices running **Gordian QR Tool** are fully logged into your Apple account, with full access to iCloud, and switches set as noted above. Failure to do so will either result in (1) QR entries not being synced to the iCloud (and other devices); or (1) QR entries being synced to other devices without the protected content of the actual code.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@LifeWithAlacrity.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâs fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
